      **If you detect a fire:**
      1.  **Sound the alarm:** Alert others immediately.
      2.  **Evacuate calmly:** Use stairs, not elevators.
      3.  **Close doors behind you:** This helps contain the fire.
      4.  **Do not re-enter:** Once outside, stay out.
      5.  **Call emergency services (999/local emergency number):** Provide your exact location.
      6.  **Crawl low under smoke:** Smoke rises, so staying low helps you see and breathe.
      7.  **"Stop, Drop, and Roll"** if your clothes catch fire.
      8.  **Know your exits:** Always be aware of two ways out.
